## Election-Audit Summary

This script provided with great efficacy the results of the congressional election. The results are concise and easy to read. But most importantly the information is reliable and safe. The script read the results of the election without any human manipulation. Therefore, it can be guaranteed that the results werenâ€™t embezzled. 

This script can be utilized for future elections regardless of the number of votes, counties or candidates. It would be suggested that the election results are stored using a CSV file and follow the same format than the one for this analysis. Some modifications could be taken into consideration. For example, the CSV file could indicate how the vote was cast and therefore make an analysis that includes what was the most popular way voters participated in the election. It could also make a comparison of previous elections and produce this analysis for different years. This script is quite versatile as you can see.
